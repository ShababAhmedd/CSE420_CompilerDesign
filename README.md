To install mingw-w64, run the following command in macOS terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal) sudo port install mingw-w64 Copy.
To see what files were installed by mingw-w64, run: port contents mingw-w64 Copy.
To later upgrade mingw-w64, run: sudo port selfupdate && sudo port upgrade mingw-w64 Copy.
if any of the above doesn't work then:
install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Once it's installed start it, and allow it to install the command line tools.
